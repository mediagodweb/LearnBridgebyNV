        <h3>Our Process</h3>
        <p>Initial Consultation:
            Students meet with a consultant to discuss their study abroad goals, interests, and preferences.
            Program Research:
            Together, we research study abroad programs that align with the student's academic and personal objectives, considering factors such as location, language, and curriculum.
            Application Process:
            Our team assists students in completing study abroad applications, ensuring they meet all requirements and deadlines.
            Visa and Travel Preparation:
            We provide guidance and support throughout the visa application process, including document preparation and interview preparation, as well as assistance with travel logistics.
            Pre-Departure Orientation:
            Students attend pre-departure orientation sessions to prepare for their study abroad experience, covering topics such as cultural adaptation, academic expectations, and safety abroad.
