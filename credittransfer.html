    <section id="what-is-transfer">
        <h2>What is Transfer Admissions?</h2>
        <p>
            Transfer admissions is the process of a current undergraduate student applying to transfer to a four-year college or university. This isn’t déjà vu. Applying to college again as a transfer student may seem like a repeat process, but the transfer admissions process is unique and can be even more selective, with different requirements, recommendations, deadlines, and essays.
        </p>
        <p>
            At LearnBridgebyNV, we work with students to help them identify their best-fit transfer schools and guide them through the admissions process so they have the best chance of admission.

    <!-- Section 2: Why Transfer Colleges -->
    <section id="why-transfer">
        <h2>Why Transfer Colleges?</h2>
        <p>
            There are many reasons why students choose to transfer schools during their higher education journey. The reality is, it’s not as simple as selecting a new college or university and enrolling, especially for students hoping to apply to more selective institutions. At LearnBridgebyNV, we work with students to understand why they want to transfer, what they want out of their new school – academically, socially, and financially – and what it will take to achieve that goal.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have your academic interests and goals changed?</li>
            <li>Is the campus experience not what you expected?</li>
            <li>Are the academics at your current school too rigorous or perhaps not challenging enough?</li>
            <li>Are you hoping to gain admission to a top school after a successful first year of college?</li>
            <li>Are you looking to transfer from a two-year school to a four-year university?</li>
            <li>Is your current school not a good financial fit?</li>
        </ul>
